# Chatbot using GPT-2 in PyTorch

This project implements a chatbot using the GPT-2 language model, a pre-trained generative language model, via Hugging Face’s `transformers` library. The goal is to create a chatbot that can generate coherent and relevant responses based on user input.

The GPT-2 model was chosen due to its capability to handle natural language generation and its easy integration with `PyTorch`.

The code in this notebook loads the model and tokenizer, and provides a `generate_response` function that processes the user’s input and generates a response based on the given context. This chatbot can be fine-tuned with additional data to improve performance for specific applications.
